# Is It Kids Safe? 🎬👶  

A Python + Streamlit app (work in progress) that helps parents quickly check whether a movie or series is suitable for children.  
The app pulls details from multiple sources, extracts key keywords, and highlights themes that may not be age-appropriate.  
It aims to provide a simple, parent-friendly dashboard for making viewing choices.
